Special Steps to compile: 	No Special Steps Needed

Design Patterns I Utilized:

							2) Pattern #9: Prospective Memory
								The program asks for confirmations when user clicks quit before the file has been saved.

							3) Pattern #10: Streamlined Repetition
								The program remembers where the last location of file dialog when save.

							4) Pattern #12: Other People's Advice
								This program has been given feedback by at least 2 people.

							5) Pattern #19: Intriguing Branches
								The program has help button to open help window which will explain features and "how to" questions.



Bugs My Program Has: 		1) no even number of each type of card is stored
                        2) when selecting "Gray" the user cannot go back to "Olive" when selecting the back of the colors

Brief Summery of Approach:

  - Designing The User Interface
  - Positioned all the Panels (selcting Card Back)
  - position Radio Buttons
  - position buttons (Save, Quit, Help)
  - Create User Control

- setting Quit Button
    - asks for confirmations when user clicks quit before the file has been saved.
    - add Application.Exit() to close the program

- setting radio buttons
    -  add Olive buttons and create an event
    - add Gray buttons and create an event
    - add Image buttons and create an event
    - add an Image groupBox
    - link the card back radio buttons to Panel

- setting "save" button
    -  create event
    -  checked all the radio Buttons
    -  write them to file by using saveDialog()

- Setting User Controls
    - add class argument (image or color)
